# Insurance Cost Prediction using PySpark  

This project demonstrates the application of **PySpark** for performing regression analysis on an **insurance dataset** to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, and smoking status.

---

## Key Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze relationships between features and insurance charges.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale numerical features using PySpark.  
- **Regression Modeling:** Implement regression techniques using PySpark MLlib to predict insurance charges.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

## Technologies Used  
- **PySpark**  
- **Python**  
- **Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **MLlib** for machine learning operations

## Workflow  
1. **Data Loading:** Load the insurance dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.  
2. **EDA:** Explore feature distributions and relationships with insurance costs.  
3. **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Encode categorical variables  
  - Scale numerical
  - Handling missing values using imputer tenchniques
  - ...
4. **Model Building:** Train regression models to predict insurance costs.  
5. **Evaluation:** Analyze model performance using metrics.

# Iris Dataset Analysis & ML Model with PySpark

This project demonstrates the analysis and machine learning model creation using the Iris dataset in PySpark. The notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, and the development of a machine learning model to predict Iris species.

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration**: The Iris dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and transformation.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A machine learning model is built using PySpark for classification of Iris species.

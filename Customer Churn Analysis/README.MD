## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Clean, transform, and prepare large-scale customer datasets for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Uncover patterns and trends influencing customer churn behavior.  
- **Churn Prediction Model:**  
  Build and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting customer churn.  
- **Insights for Retention Strategies:**  
  Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates and enhance customer retention.
